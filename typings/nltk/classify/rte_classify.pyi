"""
Simple classifier for RTE corpus.

It calculates the overlap in words and named entities between text and
hypothesis, and also whether there are words / named entities in the
hypothesis which fail to occur in the text, since this is an indicator that
the hypothesis is more informative than (i.e not entailed by) the text.

TO DO: better Named Entity classification
TO DO: add lemmatization
